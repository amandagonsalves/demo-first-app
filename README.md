# First App for the Pali Wallet Documentation

This is an test model App for the Pali Wallet. It follows the usage in the _Getting Started_ section of the [Pali Wallet Documentation](https://pali-docs.vercel.app/guide/Getting_Started.html). All the ready-to-use functions are commented in the /src/App.js file, including all the sign functions. 

After downloading, you should start with `yarn install` and then `á»³arn start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The following is a series of commands for React.

## Pali Wallet sign methods

To call signAndSend() or signPSBT() methods you will need to run a server in the root folder using:

`yarn server`

## Available Scripts

First install the project dependencies:

`yarn install`

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
